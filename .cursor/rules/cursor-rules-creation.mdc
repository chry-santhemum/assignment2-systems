# Cursor Rules Guidelines

Guidelines for creating new user-requested cursor rules.

## MDC Frontmatter Rule Types

All rule files must start with MDC frontmatter to specify rule behavior:

```mdc
---
description: (string - when rule should be applied)
globs: (comma-separated file patterns)
alwaysApply: (boolean)
---
```

### Rule Type Configuration

| Rule Type | `description` | `globs` | `alwaysApply` | Behavior |
|-----------|---------------|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Always** | blank | blank | `true` | Auto-attached to every chat/Cmd-K |
| **Auto-Attached** | blank | defined | `false` | Attached when files match glob patterns |
| **Agent-Requested** | defined | blank | `false` | AI agent fetches when relevant |
| **Manual** | blank | blank | `false` | Only when explicitly mentioned with `@` |

### Examples

**Agent-Requested Rule:**
```mdc
---
description: Use uv instead of pip for Python package management
globs: 
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Auto-Attached Rule:**
```mdc
---
description: 
globs: *.py, *.toml
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Always Rule:**
```mdc
---
description: 
globs: 
alwaysApply: true
---
```

## File Placement Guidelines

When creating Cursor rules:

1. **Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:**
   ```
   .cursor/rules/
   ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   ├── another-rule.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

2. **Follow the naming convention:**
   - Use kebab-case for filenames
   - Always use .mdc extension
   - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. **Include proper MDC frontmatter:**
   - Specify description for agent-requested rules
   - Define globs for auto-attached rules
   - Set alwaysApply: true for global rules
   - Leave fields blank for manual rules

4. **Directory structure:**
   ```
   PROJECT_ROOT/
   ├── .cursor/
   │   └── rules/
   │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   │       └── ...
   └── ...
   ```

5. **Never place rule files:**
   - In the project root
   - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
   - In any other location

6. **Frontmatter formatting:**
   - Don't quote glob patterns
   - Use comma separation for multiple globs
   - Keep descriptions concise but specific

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Quoting glob patterns: `globs: "*.py"`
- ✅ Unquoted patterns: `globs: *.py`
- ❌ Wrong location: `rules/my-rule.mdc`
- ✅ Correct location: `.cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc`
- ❌ Missing frontmatter entirely
- ✅ Complete frontmatter with all three fields
